OpenNI (Version 1.5.4.0 - May 7th 2012)
---------------------------------------

Release Notes:
--------------
* At the moment, the default is to compile the code with SSE3 support (this is also true for the supplied binaries). 
  If you have a CPU without such support, please remove the sse compiler flags from the make files.
  (A good hint for this error is that you encounter an "illegal instructions" messages)
  
Build Notes:
------------	   
Linux:
	Requirements:
		1) GCC 4.x
		   From: http://gcc.gnu.org/releases.html
		   Or via apt:
		   sudo apt-get install g++
		2) Python 2.6+/3.x
		   From: http://www.python.org/download/
		   Or via apt:
		   sudo apt-get install python
		3) LibUSB 1.0.x
		   From: http://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb/files/libusb-1.0/
		   Or via apt:
		   sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev
		4) FreeGLUT3
		   From: http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/index.php#download
		   Or via apt:
		   sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev
		5) JDK 6.0
		   From: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk-6u32-downloads-1594644.html
		   Or via apt:
		     Ubuntu 10.x:				
		       sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://archive.canonical.com/ lucid partner"
		       sudo apt-get update
		       sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jdk
		     Ubuntu 12.x:				
		       sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jdk

		   
	Optional Requirements (To build the documentation):
		1) Doxygen
		   From: http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html#latestsrc
		   Or via apt:
		   sudo apt-get install doxygen
		2) GraphViz
		   From: http://www.graphviz.org/Download_linux_ubuntu.php
		   Or via apt:
		   sudo apt-get install graphviz

	Optional Requirements (To build the Mono wrapper):
		1) Mono
		   From: http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html
		   Or via apt:
		   sudo apt-get install mono-complete
		   
	Building OpenNI:
		1) Go into the directory: "Platform/Linux/CreateRedist".
		   Run the script: "./RedistMaker".
		   This will compile everything and create a redist package in the "Platform/Linux/Redist" directory.
		   It will also create a distribution in the "Platform/Linux/CreateRedist/Final" directory.
		2) Go into the directory: "Platform/Linux/Redist".
		   Run the script: "sudo ./install.sh" (needs to run as root)

  		   The install script copies key files to the following location:
		       Libs into: /usr/lib
		       Bins into: /usr/bin
		       Includes into: /usr/include/ni
		       Config files into: /var/lib/ni
			
		To build the package manually, you can run "make" in the "Platform\Linux\Build" directory.
		If you wish to build the Mono wrappers, also run "make mono_wrapper" and "make mono_samples".
		
	Building OpenNI using a cross-compiler:
		1) Make sure to define two environment variables:
		   - <platform>_CXX - the name of the cross g++ for platform <platform>
		   - <platform>_STAGING - a path to the staging dir (a directory which simulates the target root filesystem).
		   Note that <platform> should be upper cased.
		   For example, if wanting to compile for ARM from a x86 machine, ARM_CXX and ARM_STAGING should be defined.
		2) Go into the directory: "Platform/Linux/CreateRedist".
		   Run: "./RedistMaker <platform>" (for example: "./RedistMake Arm").
		   This will compile everything and create a redist package in the "Platform/Linux/Redist" directory.
		   It will also create a distribution in the "Platform/Linux/CreateRedist/Final" directory.
		3) To install OpenNI files on the target file system:
		   Go into the directory: "Platform/Linux/Redist".
		   Run the script: "./install.sh -c $<platform>_STAGING" (for example: "./install.sh -c $ARM_STAGING").

  		   The install script copies key files to the following location:
		       Libs into: STAGING/usr/lib
		       Bins into: STAGING/usr/bin
		       Includes into: STAGING/usr/include/ni
		       Config files into: STAGING/var/lib/ni
			
		To build the package manually, you can run "make PLATFORM=<platform>" in the "Platform\Linux\Build" directory.
		If you wish to build the Mono wrappers, also run "make PLATFORM=<platform> mono_wrapper" and "make PLATFORM=<platform> mono_samples".
